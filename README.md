# screen-melter

The code (as many similar), based off of [Napalm's original](http://www.rohitab.com/discuss/topic/23191-screen-melter/).
However, many (if any) do not implement **multi-monitor support**, which ruins the effect. This version does. Plus, I added some **args** too.

### Args:

 - Disable user input: `--disable_input` (ctrl+alt+del still works)
 - Sleep time before visual effect (ms): `-t`, `--time` Example: `-t 2000`, `--time=2000`
